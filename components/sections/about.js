          <p className="my-4">
            Founder Anthony Torres believes there&apos;s more to business than maximizing shareholder value. 
            It&apos;s about achieving health, leaving the world better than we found it, thriving in our environment, 
            elevating others, and doing meaningful, challenging work.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            At BitHippie we approach this from the inside outâ€”starting with personal development and a growth-mindset, guided by quarterly 
            work & life goal-setting, supported by accountability, all within a culture of psychological safety.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            We strive daily to be our best so we can give you our best.
