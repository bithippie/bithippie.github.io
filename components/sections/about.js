          <p className="my-4">
            Founder Anthony Torres believes there's more to business than maximizing shareholder value. 
            It's about achieving health, leaving the world better than we found it, thriving in our environment, 
            elevating others, and doing meaningful, challenging work.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            At BitHippie we approach this from the inside outâ€”starting with personal development and a growth-mindset, guided by quarterly 
            work & life goal-setting, supported by accountability, all within a culture of psychological safety.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            We strive daily to be our best so we can give you our best.
          </p>
