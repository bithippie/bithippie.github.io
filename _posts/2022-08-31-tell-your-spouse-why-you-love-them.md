I was out in the backyard fiddling with the fire pit and listening to the Dad Edge Podcast. Yard work + sunlight + personal development is my self-care ritual. After finishing a few podcast episodes, hearing both the positive and negative experiences in various peoples’ lives, I realized it has been a while since I’ve told Julie how much I appreciate her. I decided to jot down the first few descriptive reasons that came to mind. 

This is what I came up with...

![Just wanted to say I'm thinking about you and I love you. I love you for being a rock in our family. I love you for taking such good care of me while I've been cranky. I love you for helping me make the fire pit look really good. And I love you for letting me cuddle your squishy tushy. Now come home!👻 ](/assets/images/posts/tell_your_spouse_why_you_love_them/thinking_of_you.png){: .align-right}

Quick Aside: If you looking to be a better father, husband, son, or leader, I can recommend nothing higher than [The Dad Edge Podcast](https://thedadedge.com/podcast/).


I’ve been in a funk these last few days. Overall, everything is going mostly well. There’s these few nagging problems in the background pecking at my attention, making me doubt myself. Julie has really been picking up my slack with the family these last few days. She’s the one keeping the positive energy in our house. I wish I could say I tried to make it better, but I barely did. 

Today, I broke this faux stained glass Capri’s had made. She knew the consequences if she jumped on the couch again. "If you break something of mine, I'm going to break something of yours." Of course she was going to jump on the couch again, that's what three-nagers do. One-sided Hammurabi's code definitely wasn't the right move in this situation. Regardless, Julie backed me up. 

Getting back to the text message, Julie is currently at the county fair with both girls. I was invited, but I had said I didn't want to go. She knew I needed some space, so we packed up both girls and off to the fair they went.

She's Wonder Woman.

Some time had passed since I sent that message. Finally, a response!

![I love everything about that message. It means the world! I love you too!! We are on our way. Can you do the veggies please 😘😘😘](/assets/images/posts/tell_your_spouse_why_you_love_them/it_means_the_world.png)

And just like that, all feels right. It was like a light switch. The important things are going right. The nagging problems feel less powerful. I can’t wait for the family to get home from the fair. 

For those reading this - I challenge you to stop what you're doing and tell your significant other all the reasons you love them . **Be specific!**  They want to hear it. And, it'll make you feel better too.

If you're willing, let me know how it worked out for you in [this Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bithippie/comments/x381qh/tell_your_spouse_why_you_love_them/).
