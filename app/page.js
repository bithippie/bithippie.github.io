              In as little as 1 Month you and your customers will see the manifestation of your idea. You’ll collect valuable data from your users, and you’ll move forward with an informed opinion about how best to proceed!

              <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
              What is your minimum engagement?
              We know teams come with many different kinds of constraints. We try to work within everyone’s scope and budget.

              That said, the smallest engagement we’ll accept is a one 1 month commitment and a budget of $12,000 USD.

              The listed price does not indicate the price of a contract, pricing is a function of scope and complexity. This minimum has been provided to serve as a safeguard in the event your budget constraints are less our threshold.

              We do offer discounted rates for engagements that are for 3 or more consecutive months.

              Our Sustainable Engineering model is designed to give you access to high quality Software, Data, and Cloud Engineers and Architects. Allowing you to keep your headcount and operating expenses low.

              We scope work into 1 month Milestones, consisting of (2) two-week Sprints, totaling 20 business days.

              At the beginning of each Milestone all key stakeholders align on the main objectives.

              The sprints serve as checkpoints within the Milestone to demonstrate progress, and provides an opportunity to realign in the event the circumstances change.

              We have ad hoc as well as recurring engagement models.

              Our ad hoc model, the end of the Milestone signals the end of the arrangement.

              In a recurring engagement, you’ll have access to the same team for as long as you need. We do require 30 days notice to conclude the engagement.

              How are payments structured?
              Payment structure depends on the length of the engagement.

              Ad hoc Engagements:

              1 Milestone (4 weeks), payment is submitted in thirds:

              1/3 Is required to schedule a kick-off.

              1/3 is due after we’ve completed the 1st sprint.

              1/3 is due after we’ve completed the 2nd sprint.

              Recurring Engagement:

              3 or more Milestones (12+ weeks), an invoice is submitted in arrears for the month with a Net 30 due date.

              What if I'm not happy?
              While we never want to get to that point, our Sustainable Engineering models is structured such that you can end the relationship in at most 1 Month.

              When you provide notice to terminate the arrangement, all future development work plans will be suspended and you will only be invoiced for work delivered and any off-boarding work you authorize us to conclude.

              We will do our best to make the situation right before we need to take more severe measures such as terminating the arrangement.

              <p>
                BitHippie was started by Founder and serial entrepreneur, Anthony Torres, when he came to the realization that mission and the people impacted matter much more than maximizing shareholder value.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to stay true to that ethos is by aligning his efforts with the kind of people who care about the Earth and its inhabitants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than do this work alone, Anthony combined his passions for making things, personal development, and service into a one-of-a-kind community, a force for good.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together he, and the friends made along the way, work together to make real change in the world, hold one another accountable, improve and maintain our health, and constantly remind one another that “together we go far.”
