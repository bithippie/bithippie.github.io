# My journey of self-discovery, solving hard problems, investing in a brighter future, and giving back.

_Disclaimer: I'm don't really know how this is going to shape up, but I've heard the best thing to do was start typing. 
In the spirit of iterative development, I'm going to trust the process._

I don't claim to be an expert in any of these topic, but I have been a software engineer for half my life. 
I love adventure, travel, and the great outdoors. I am a very curious person, and a life long learner. 
I hope for a brighter future for the next generations and I'm willing to work to make that happen.

The reason for putting it down on paper is threefold. 
1. This content serves as a living journal & portfolio that I can refer back to later.
2. Everyone is at a different phase in life, perhaps you can learn from my experience and you can teach me!
3. My family and I want to travel the world. I can think of no better way to connect with people who are of a similiar mindset. 

For now I think I'm going to break up the side into a few different domains.
