Before reading any further, please first head over to my [values](/values) page. Once you understand where I'm coming from, the rest of this page is going to make way more sense.

## My mission in life is actually pretty simple. 

* I want to be happy and healthy. I will freely help anyone interested achieving the same.
* I want to have a positive impact on the lives and ecosystems in which I operate.
* I want to build useful things in a sustainable fashion.
* I want to make the most out of my short time on this delicate blue marble floating about space. 

I think it's that simple; simple, but not easy. It requires work. It requires being diligent and intentional about how I spend my time. Using Napoleon Hill's words, it requires ["Definiteness of Purpose"](https://amzn.to/3J0BIRK)<small>(Affiliate Link)</small>. 

People have said to me "If you want something, you have to put it out into the Universe."

To that end, I'm giving it a shot üöÄ

## Here are some big problems I would like to participate in solving.

* How might we spend more time doing what we love while minimizing time spend doing the things we don't?
* How might we level up an individuals emotional, physical, spiritual, and financial wellbeing?
* How might we sustainably improve the quality and diversity of ecosystems without requiring massive external inputs?
* How might we remove the vast amount of [macro and micro] plastic in our water?
* How might we decentralize farming and make it easy for hobbyists to provide nutritious food to their households and local communities?
* How might we combat climate change? 
* How might we make it affordable for people to explore the richness of our world?

## Here are some of my bucket list items in no particular order.
* ü•á Complete my first Half Ironman. I currently have my eyes set on [Melbourne](https://www.ironman.com/im703-melbourne).
* üõ∏ Take a commercial space flight.
* ü§ø Go scuba diving at the most beautiful places. I recently received my [PADI Open Water Certification](https://www.padi.com/education) and I'm already hooked.
* üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Own a [mostly] black Savannah Cat.
* üèî Have a house in the mountains that overlooks a beautiful landscape.
* üèù Spend months at a time in new places. Costa Rica for starters? 

## Here are some things I could use help with.
* A better BitHippie Logo.
* I would love to connect with a naturopath to optimize my personal health plan.  
* An experienced triathlete coach, or buddy, to help make my Ironman dream a reality.
* I want to build a 3d puzzle box using CNC.
* Someone semi-local with equipment to turn my milled cherry slabs into an epoxy desktop.
* ... guess I don't need much right now.

## What I can offer you.
* My software related accolades can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bithippie/) profile. If you need a technical sounding board, I have a wide breadth of experience in the hard and soft skills surrounding Software, Data, and Cloud Platform Engineering & leadership skills. 
* I'm really good at spending little to accomplishing much. For example running this entire website cost me $12/year plus tax. I'm learning how to use Amazon Affiliate links to cover those domain name cost. If you're thinking about starting a business and need some technical consultation, I'll happily gift anyone an hour of my time to get you pointed in the right direction.
* I've recently overhauled large areas of my life, including my health, my relationship with my spouse, how I treat my work, and being alcohol free for 3+ years. If you need an accountability buddy, I'm here to help.
* My wife tells me "You have figured out how to be a functional partner.", "You're a great dad.", "Your kids love it when you're around". If you want to chat kids, I'm by no means an expert, but I may be able to provide a different perspective, or just lend an ear.
* I have a plan to achieve F.I.R.E. by 2028. If financial freedom is important to you, especially younger folks who aren't sure where to start, I'd love to chat. There's no magic bullet here, it's a slow, methodical process. It takes investing in your future self; it takes sacrificing immediate gratitude; it takes consistency over long periods of time; and most importantly it's achievable to anyone willing to put in the reps. 
* There are likely many other areas that I haven't thought of. I'll add to this list over time as stuff bubbles up.

If you're still with me so far, let's see how we can help each other! 

This is not intended to be quid pro quo. If you see something in here that can help you or can help me, let's talk.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bithippie/). Let me know what's on your mind and that you came from my site.

Until Then ‚úåÔ∏è
