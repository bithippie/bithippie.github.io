  A social experiment to rethink how [value](/values){:target="_blank"} is measured.

## My mission in life is actually pretty simple. 

* I want to be happy, healthy, and wealthy. 
* I want to make useful and beautiful things.
* I want my work to positively impact others.
* I want to have meaningful relationships.
* I want to leave nothing on the table.

People have said to me "If you want something, you have to put it out into the Universe."

To that end, I'm giving it a shot 🚀

## These are some big problems I think would be fun to have a part in solving.

* Find ways to enable everyone to spend more time doing what we love.
* Leveling up individuals' emotional, physical, spiritual, and financial wellbeing.
* Reducing dependence on disposable plastic and ultra processed foods.
* Decentralized micro-farms.
* Affordable ways for families to safely and comfortably explore the global.

## Bucket list items in no particular order.

* 🥇 ~~Complete my first Half Iron-man.~~  Just finished [Musselman 70.3!](https://www.ironman.com/im703-musselman){:target="_blank"}
* 🛸 Take a commercial space flight.
* 🤿 Go scuba diving in vibrant locations.
* 🐈‍⬛ Own a big kitty, probably a Savannah Cat.
* 🏔 Have a house in the mountains that overlooks a vast and interesting landscape.
* 🏝 Spend months at a time in new places. Costa Rica for starters!

## Here are some things I could use help with.
* ✅ ~~A better BitHippie Logo.~~
    
    Thanks again, Suzi! Check out [her work](https://suzanneandrewsfineart.com/){:target="_blank"}, there's so much beautiful artwork to see.
* ✅ ~~An experienced triathlete coach, or buddy, to help make my Iron-man dream a reality.~~

    I recently joined a Tri Club and they paired me with a mentor who has been amazing!
* I would love to connect with a naturopath to optimize my personal health plan.
* I want to learn how to design and build 3d puzzle boxes.
* Someone semi-local with equipment to turn my milled cherry slabs into an epoxy desktop.
* Looking for recommendations on ways to store the most relational/transactional data for the least money.
* ... guess I don't need much right now.

## What I have to offer.
* 🤓 My career related accolades can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bithippie/){:target="_blank"}.
* 💰 I'm really good at spending little to accomplishing much. For example running this website cost me ~$12/year.
* 💻 I can help you rapidly prototype an idea and provide longer-term technical guidance.
* ❤️ I've recently overhauled large areas of my life from my health, to many of my relationships, how I think about work, and being alcohol free for 4+ years. If you need an accountability buddy, I can help.
* 🏠 My wife tells me "You have figured out how to be a functional partner.", "You're a great dad.", "Your kids love it when you're around". If you want to chat kids, I'm by no means an expert, but I may be able to provide a different perspective, or just lend an ear.
* 🔥 I have a plan to achieve F.I.R.E. by 2028 through a combination of income streams. If financial freedom is important to you, especially younger folks who aren't sure where to start, I'd love to chat. 

If you're still with me so far, let's see how we can help each other! 

This is not intended to be quid pro quo. If you see something in here that can help you or can help me, let's talk.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bithippie/){:target="_blank"}. Let me know what's on your mind and that you came from my site.

Until Then ✌️
