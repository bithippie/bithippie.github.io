A guide for empowering BitHippies

### Have a servant's mentality
Seek to add value to others; it will come back to you in time.

### Make decisions through a lens of abundance.
This is not a zero-sum game, the pie gets bigger!

### Your only competition is yourself; play the infinite game.
Comparison is the thief of joy.

### Keep a light footprint.
Be thoughtful about reducing the waste you produce. 

### Leave it better than you found it.
Invest in future you, future us, future them.

### Don’t be afraid to take calculated risks. 
Growth exists outside the comfortable. 

### Own your failures. Share other’s successes.
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

### Act as if everyone is watching. 
Have integrity and honor.

### Be curious.
Seek to understand. Try things. Don't be afraid of failure.
