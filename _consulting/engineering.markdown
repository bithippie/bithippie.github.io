## Information Is The New Oil

In today's data driven age, there are virtually limitless data sources available to choose from. You could integrate with data partners, pull from public data sets, purchase curated assets from another company, and measure user behavior within your systems & products. 

**With so many options at your fingertips, it's important to be able to quickly identify signal from the noise.**

Good data handling processes are the difference between fumbling around in the dark searching for answers, or having a deep understanding about what is happening internally within your business and externally in the world at large. 

## Common Pitfalls

Data providers package and deliver their content using many different mechanisms. This usually means custom adapters for each data source leading to sprawl.

If your information is not well documented and organized, different functions within your organization won't know what's available, leading to missed insights or purchasing nearly identical information!

There is no shortage of information available. 

However, too often quantity data is mistaken for quality information.
