## The Age of Information

A modern business knows the importance of investing in their website and branding. Partners and Customers make snap decisions about the quality of your business [within the first 10 seconds](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/). **Your APIs are a direct extension of your public-facing digital presence.** Avoid the pitfall of making it challenging for data consumers to access and utilize your information gold.

APIs (Application Programming Interface) serve as the blueprint for describing how and what data are exchanged. Whether you're operating in the B2B or B2C space, adhering to industry best practices for information exchange is critical! 

## Startups can't afford to do everything.

In today's data-driven age, **speed of learning is the new competitive advantage**. 

It is much more cost effective, and mission effective, to delegate non-critical activities to companies who are winning in their respective field. A culture of information sharing allows you to focus on your unique value proposition while gaining valuable insights from your partners who excel in their respective domains.

When a data partner doesn't understand how to use your company's information it quickly devolves into lost productivity ðŸ“‰, support chains ðŸ“§, or guessing what to do ðŸ˜±.

## We help you:

- Select API methodologies and conventions that are ideal for your specific circumstances.
- Implement smart documentation practices so your API specs are always up to date. 
- Adopt industry standard practices for common concerns such as authentication & authorization, pagination, limits, resource routing and more.
- Publish your API specs and health checks so integrators don't need to guess.

Our API services are designed to ensure that the way you share information with your customers is intuitive, scalable, secure, and thoroughly documented. 

Getting this foundation right from the start leads to happy data-partner relationships, the efficiencies gained from automating information exchange, and most importantly, quicker actionable insights. 

This strategic advantage allows you to outpace your competition by learning faster and staying one step ahead.
