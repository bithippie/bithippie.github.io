## Today

It's commonplace for startups to leverage the cloud, in fact it's expected. Why take on the burden of managing the hardware, software, personnel, and real estate yourself? It's the smart move. If you and I know it, the Cloud Providers know it too.

The baseline price of operating in the cloud has been climbing ðŸ“ˆ. Example: [Cloud Storage Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing-announce) 

It's more important than ever that your Cloud Architecture is fit for purpose. **Just a few instances left on, or oversized for the work will quickly eat $10,000s/year that would otherwise grow your business.** Take a few minutes to search online, there are many cautionary tails where cloud users received a [surprise bill](https://www.google.com/search?q=surprise+aws+bill) from their provider. 

Conversely, if you aren't thinking about where you hope to be in 3 years, expect to budget a major technical migration into the roadmap, pulling your engineers focus away from the mission.

Getting this right is an art. Don't leave it up to chance.
